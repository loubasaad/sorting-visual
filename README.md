# sorting-visual

    Abstract:
This project’s goal is to implement a program that does the animation of sorting algorithms. The user is allowed to put whichever algorithm in the form of pseudo-code, so that he can see its animation.


    Introduction:
Computer Science is full of utilizations of sorting algorithms. Either in fields of algorithm analysis, operating systems, or many other fields, sorting algorithms are used to sort different elements, and some algorithms are made to further optimize this sorting. Moreover, there are several tens of existing sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and situations to be used in. These aforementioned thoughts made me impressed by how strong and dazzling many of these algorithms are, and made me motivated to do something that would help people in the process of learning them. 
This program’s objective is to allow the user to enter an array of elements he wants to sort, and the pseudo-code of the sorting algorithm he wants to use, and the program would do the animation for him. To reach that objective, the program reads the algorithm line by line, and makes the animation of each line separately. Also, the program follows certain specifications and syntax that would be imposed on the user in the pseudo-code he enters


    What does the program do?
This program functions following these steps:
  1- The program is prompted. The user is asked to enter the number of elements he wants to sort;
  2- The user enters 5 as the number of elements for instance, and then starts entering the elements themselves;
  3- Once the five elements are entered, the user is prompted to enter the pseudo-code of the algorithm;
